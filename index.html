        <h2>Product Features</h2>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Obstacle Detection and Proximity Sensing:</strong> Visionex uses ultrasonic sensors to scan for obstacles, alerting the user to their proximity. The system detects various obstacles, including walls, stairs, and objects in their path.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Environmental Mapping:</strong> The glasses create a dynamic, real-time map of the surroundings, adapting as the user moves through different environments. This feature enhances spatial awareness and helps avoid potential hazards.</li>
            <li><strong>Detailed Audio Feedback:</strong> The system offers precise audio cues, such as "wall ahead," "stairs left," or "open door," helping the user navigate with ease. The feedback is customizable based on the user’s preferences and needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Front-Facing Camera with Image Recognition:</strong> This allows Visionex to identify obstacles visually and convey detailed descriptions through the speaker. The camera identifies common obstacles like tables, chairs, and people, and provides context-sensitive information.</li>
            <li><strong>Lightweight and Comfortable:</strong> The ergonomic design ensures comfort and long-term wearability. The glasses are adjustable to fit different head sizes and are designed to be worn for extended periods without discomfort.</li>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p class="details">Visionex uses ultrasonic sensors to emit sound waves and detect obstacles based on the returning echoes. The sensor data is processed in real time, allowing the system to estimate the distance to nearby objects. The front-facing camera continuously scans the environment, capturing images of the surrounding space. Advanced image recognition algorithms analyze the camera feed and identify various obstacles.</p>
        <p class="details">Once obstacles are detected, the system communicates the necessary information to the user through an audio output near their ear. The feedback can be adjusted in terms of volume and type of information provided. In addition to proximity alerts, the system can describe the size, type, and shape of obstacles, helping the user understand the environment better.</p>
        <p class="details">Visionex also has built-in safety features to ensure that the user is always aware of their surroundings. For example, the system can alert the user when they are nearing a high-risk area, such as the edge of a staircase or an open door, ensuring maximum safety in different environments.</p>
